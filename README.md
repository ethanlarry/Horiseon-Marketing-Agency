# Horiseon-Marketing-Agency

The Horiseon Marketing Agency website features nav bar, three sections featuring images with descriptions, an aside with
further information, and a footer. However the lack of semantic html elements, unefficient css, and useless classes was an
apparent issue. I was motivated to pursue this project to make sure my client's website follows accessibility standards so 
that the site is optimized for search engines.

There were a multitude of things wrong with this website such as unnnecessary class attributes, no alt descriptions for 
images, and a nondescriptive title. But the most common error I encountered was the lack of semantic html elements. 
Therefore, I replaced many div elements with semantic elements including section, main, and footer. In my pursuit to replace 
div elements, I learned the semantic elements aside, figure, and figcaption.
